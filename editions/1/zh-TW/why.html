<h2 id="why">為何要用 CouchDB？</h2>

<p>Apache CouchDB 是一個新類型的資料庫管理系統。這一章會解釋為何有需要新的系統以及建立 CouchDB 背後的動機。

<p>作為 CouchDB 的開發者，我們自然對使用 CouchDB 感到十分雀躍。這一章我們將會分享為何我們這樣熱情。我們會展示 CouchDB 的無架構文件模型如何較為適合一般的軟體，如何使用內建的查詢系統去有效地使用和處理你的資料，以及 CouchDB 的設計如何使它模組化和可延展。

<h3 id="relax">放鬆</h3>

<p>如果說有一個詞可以形容 CouchDB，那便是<em>放鬆</em>。它在本書的標題之中，在 CouchDB 的官方標語之中，甚至在你啟動 CouchDB 時，你也會見到：

<pre>
Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.
</pre>

<p>為何放鬆這樣重要？開發者的生產力在近五年幾乎倍增。這增幅的主要原因是更強大更易用的工具。以 Ruby on Rails 為例，它是個無比複雜的框架，但它很容易上手。Rails 的成功正因為它以易用為主要的設計目標。這是其中一個原因為何 CouchDB 要放鬆：只要曾經做過一些網路的工作，學習 CouchDB 和理解它的主要概念應該相當自然。而對非技術人員來說它仍然相當容易解釋。

<p>不會在創作人嘗試建立解決方案時擋路本身就是一個重要的功能，而這正是 CouchDB 想做對的地方。我們覺得現有的工具無論在開發時還是實用時也很累贅，因此我們決定把 CouchDB 做得易用，甚至易用得讓人愉快。在<a href="tour.html">第三章</a>和<a href="api.html">第四章</a>將會示範直觀的基於 HTTP 的 Rest API。
	
<p>另一個讓 CouchDB 用家放鬆的是它的生產環境設定。如果你有一個運行中的軟體，CouchDB 會站在一旁避免打擾你。它的內部架構是容錯的，錯誤會在受控的環境下優雅地被處理。獨立的問題不會影響整個系統，只會隔離在單一的請求中。

<p>CouchDB 的核心概念是簡單 (強大) 而且清楚明白。操作團隊 (如果有團隊；沒有團隊的話那便是你) 不用害怕突然發生的不能追蹤的錯誤。即使任何事情出錯，你可以輕易找出問題所在 -- 雖然這種情況很少。

<p>CouchDB 設計成可以處理不定的流量。當一個網站面對暴增的流量時，CouchDB 可以接收大量同時的請求而不會倒下。處理每個請求的時間可能稍為增加，但他們都會被回應。當暴增的流量過去，CouchDB 又會回復到正常速度。 

<p>第三個可以放鬆的地方是增加或減少你軟體底下的硬體。這通常被稱作<em>延展性</em>。CouchDB 對程式員作出一系列的限制。初看會覺得 CouchDB 很不靈活，但有些功能是設計上沒有加入的，因為如果 CouchDB 支援這些功這，它會讓程式員寫出不能應付延展性的軟體。我們會在「<a href="index.html#part/iv">第四章 配置 CouchDB </a>」探討 CouchDB 的延展性。

<p>簡言而之，CouchDB 不會讓你做些會讓你展些遇上麻煩的事。有時這會要你忘記你以前在工作學會的最佳實踐。在<a href="recipes.html">第二十四章 錦囊</a>裡有一系列日常工序和怎樣在 CouchDB 中解決它們。

<h3 id="different">另一種建立數據模型的方法</h3>

<p>我們相信 CouchDB 會大幅改變你建立以為件為中心的軟體的方法。CouchDB 簡單地結合直觀的文件儲存模型和強大的查詢引擎，你會不禁去問「為甚麼之前沒有人做類似的東西？」

<blockquote>

<p>Django 也許是<em>為</em>網路而作的，但 CouchDB 則<em>成為</em>了網路。我從沒見過軟件這麼完全地涵蓋 HTTP 背後的哲學。 CouchDB 讓 Django 變得老派，就像 Django 讓 ASP 顯得過時一樣。

<p class="attribution">&mdash;Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Django 開發者

</blockquote>

<p>CouchDB 讓計借取了讓多網路的架構、資源的概念、方法和表現方式。在此之上它增加了強大的查詢、map、結合和過濾你的資料。加上容錯，強大的延申性，增量的複制，CouchDB 定義了文件資料庫的甜蜜點。

<h3 id="better">更適合一般軟件</h3>

<p>我們寫軟體為了改善自己和別人的生活。通常這包括收集一些普通的資料 -- 例如連絡人、收據、發票 -- 接著用電腦軟體去操作它們。CouchDB 十分適合這類一般的用途，因為它的資料模型擁抱著這種自然的想法：一些會演化，自給自足的文件。

<h4 id="containment">自給自足的資料</h4>

<p>An invoice contains all the pertinent information about a single transaction—the seller, the buyer, the date, and a list of the items or services sold. As shown in <a href="#figure/1">Figure 1, “Self-contained documents”</a>, there’s no abstract reference on this piece of paper that points to some other piece of paper with the seller’s name and address. Accountants appreciate the simplicity of having everything in one place. And given the choice, programmers appreciate that, too.

<div class="figure" id="figure/1">

<img src="why/01.png">

<p class="caption">圖 1. 自給自足的資料

</div>

<p>Yet using references is exactly how we model our data in a relational database! Each invoice is stored in a table as a row that refers to other rows in other tables—one row for seller information, one for the buyer, one row for each item billed, and more rows still to describe the item details, manufacturer details, and so on and so forth.

<p>This isn’t meant as a detraction of the relational model, which is widely applicable and extremely useful for a number of reasons. Hopefully, though, it illustrates the point that sometimes your model may not “fit” your data in the way it occurs in the real world.

<p>Let’s take a look at the humble contact database to illustrate a different way of modeling data, one that more closely “fits” its real-world counterpart—a pile of business cards. Much like our invoice example, a business card contains all the important information, right there on the cardstock. We call this “self-contained” data, and it’s an important concept in understanding document databases like CouchDB.

<h4 id="information">語法和語義</h4>

<p>Most business cards contain roughly the same information—someone’s identity, an affiliation, and some contact information. While the exact form of this information can vary between business cards, the general information being conveyed remains the same, and we’re easily able to recognize it as a business card. In this sense, we can describe a business card as a <em>real-world document</em>.

<p>Jan’s business card might contain a phone number but no fax number, whereas J. Chris’s business card contains both a phone and a fax number. Jan does not have to make his lack of a fax machine explicit by writing something as ridiculous as “Fax: None” on the business card. Instead, simply omitting a fax number implies that he doesn’t have one.

<p>We can see that real-world documents of the same type, such as business cards, tend to be very similar in <em>semantics</em>—the sort of information they carry—but can vary hugely in <em>syntax</em>, or how that information is structured. As human beings, we’re naturally comfortable dealing with this kind of variation.

<p>While a traditional relational database requires you to model your data <em>up front</em>, CouchDB’s schema-free design unburdens you with a powerful way to aggregate your data <em>after the fact</em>, just like we do with real-world documents. We’ll look in depth at how to design applications with this underlying storage paradigm.

<h3 id="blocks">更大系統的組件</h3>

<p>CouchDB is a storage system useful on its own. You can build many applications with the tools CouchDB gives you. But CouchDB is designed with a bigger picture in mind. Its components can be used as building blocks that solve storage problems in slightly different ways for larger and more complex systems.

<p>Whether you need a system that’s crazy fast but isn’t too concerned with reliability (think logging), or one that guarantees storage in two or more physically separated locations for reliability, but you’re willing to take a performance hit, CouchDB lets you build these systems.

<p>There are a multitude of knobs you could turn to make a system work better in one area, but you’ll affect another area when doing so. One example would be the CAP theorem discussed in the next chapter. To give you an idea of other things that affect storage systems, see Figures <a href="#figure/2">2</a> and <a href="#figure/3">3</a>.

<p>By reducing latency for a given system (and that is true not only for storage systems), you affect concurrency and throughput capabilities.

<p class="caption">圖 3. 延申性：讀取要求、寫入要求、資料

</div>

<p>When you want to scale out, there are three distinct issues to deal with: scaling read requests, write requests, and data. Orthogonal to all three and to the items shown in Figures <a href="#figure/2">2</a> and <a href="#figure/3">3</a> are many more attributes like reliability or simplicity. You can draw many of these graphs that show how different features or attributes pull into different directions and thus shape the system they describe.

<p>CouchDB is very flexible and gives you enough building blocks to create a system shaped to suit your exact problem. That’s not saying that CouchDB can be bent to solve any problem—CouchDB is no silver bullet—but in the area of data storage, it can get you a long way.

<h4 id="replication">CouchDB 複制</h4>

<p>CouchDB replication is one of these building blocks. Its fundamental function is to synchronize two or more CouchDB databases. This may sound simple, but the simplicity is key to allowing replication to solve a number of problems: reliably synchronize databases between multiple machines for redundant data storage; distribute data to a cluster of CouchDB instances that share a subset of the total number of requests that hit the cluster (load balancing); and distribute data between physically distant locations, such as one office in New York and another in Tokyo.

<p>CouchDB replication uses the same REST API all clients use. HTTP is ubiquitous and well understood. Replication works incrementally; that is, if during replication anything goes wrong, like dropping your network connection, it will pick up where it left off the next time it runs. It also only transfers data that is needed to synchronize databases.

<p>A core assumption CouchDB makes is that things can go wrong, like network connection troubles, and it is designed for graceful error recovery instead of assuming all will be well. The replication system’s incremental design shows that best. The ideas behind “things that can go wrong” are embodied in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a>:

<li>網路是安全的</li>

<li>網路架構不會改變</li>

<li>所有網路同質</li>

</ol>

<p>Existing tools often try to hide the fact that there is a network and that any or all of the previous conditions don’t exist for a particular system. This usually results in fatal error scenarios when something finally goes wrong. In contrast, CouchDB doesn’t try to hide the network; it just handles errors gracefully and lets you know when actions on your end are required.

<h3 id="local">本地的資料為王</h3>

<p>CouchDB takes quite a few lessons learned from the Web, but there is one thing that could be improved about the Web: latency. Whenever you have to wait for an application to respond or a website to render, you almost always wait for a network connection that isn’t as fast as you want it at that point. Waiting a few seconds instead of milliseconds greatly affects user experience and thus user satisfaction.

<p>What do you do when you are offline? This happens all the time—your DSL or cable provider has issues, or your iPhone, G1, or Blackberry has no bars, and no connectivity means no way to get to your data.

<p>CouchDB can solve this scenario as well, and this is where scaling is important again. This time it is scaling down. Imagine CouchDB installed on phones and other mobile devices that can synchronize data with centrally hosted CouchDBs when they are on a network. The synchronization is not bound by user interface constraints like subsecond response times. It is easier to tune for high bandwidth and higher latency than for low bandwidth and very low latency. Mobile applications can then use the local CouchDB to fetch data, and since no remote networking is required for that, latency is low by default.

<p>Can you really use CouchDB on a phone? Erlang, CouchDB’s implementation language has been designed to run on embedded devices magnitudes smaller and less powerful than today’s phones.

<h3 id="wrap">總結</h3>
